This code is a Java implementation of a ClientHandler class for a chat application. The 
ClientHandler is responsible for handling client connections, receiving and broadcasting 
messages to other clients.

### 1. Import statements:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.lang.reflect.Array;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
Import the necessary classes for handling input/output operations, sockets, and array lists.

### 2. Class declaration and global class list:

```java
public class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
public static ArrayList<ClientHandler> clientHandlers = new ArrayList<>();
```
Declare the ClientHandler class, which implements the Runnable interface, allowing it to be executed on a separate thread.
Define a static ArrayList called clientHandlers, which stores all the connected clients' ClientHandler objects.

### 3. Attributes:

```java
private Socket socket;
private BufferedReader bufferedReader;
private BufferedWriter bufferedWriter;
private String clientUsername;
```
Define the attributes for the ClientHandler: the client's Socket, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and clientUsername.


### 4. Constructor:

```java
public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
    try {
        this.socket = socket;
        this.bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));
        this.bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        this.clientUsername = bufferedReader.readLine();
        clientHandlers.add(this);
        broadcastMessage("SERVER: " + clientUsername + " has entered the chat!");
    } catch (IOException error) {
        closeEverything(socket, bufferedReader, bufferedWriter);
    }
}
```
The constructor accepts a Socket as a parameter and initializes the ClientHandler's attributes.
Create a BufferedWriter and a BufferedReader for the client's socket.
Read the client's username from the input stream.
Add the newly created ClientHandler object to the list of clientHandlers.
Broadcast a message to all clients that the new user has entered the chat.
Handle any IOException that may occur during initialization.

### 5. run method:

```java
@Override
public void run() {
    String messageFromClient;

    while (socket.isConnected()) {
        try {
            messageFromClient = bufferedReader.readLine();
            broadcastMessage(messageFromClient);
        } catch (IOException error) {
            closeEverything(socket, bufferedReader, bufferedWriter);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
Implement the run method from the Runnable interface.
Continuously read messages from the client and broadcast them to other clients while the socket is connected.
If an IOException occurs, close all resources and break out of the loop.

### 6. broadcastMessage method:

```java
public void broadcastMessage(String messageToSend) {
    for (ClientHandler client : clientHandlers) {
        try {
            if (!client.clientUsername.equals(clientUsername)) {
                client.bufferedWriter.write(messageToSend);
                client.bufferedWriter.newLine();
                client.bufferedWriter.flush();
            }
        } catch (IOException error) {
            closeEverything(socket, bufferedReader, bufferedWriter);
        }
    }
}
```
Define a method to broadcast a message to all connected clients, except for the sender.
Loop through the clientHandlers list, and for each client, write the message, add a new line, and flush the BufferedWriter.

### 7. removeClientHandler method:

```java
public void removeClientHandler() {
    clientHandlers.remove(this);
    broadcastMessage("SERVER: " + clientUsername + " has left the chat!");
}
```
Define a method to remove the current ClientHandler object from the clientHandlers list.
Broadcast a message to all clients informing them that the user has left the chat.

### 8.closeEverything method:

```java
public void closeEverything(Socket socket, BufferedReader bufferedReader, BufferedWriter bufferedWriter) {
removeClientHandler();

    try {
        if (socket != null) {
            socket.close();
        }
        if (bufferedReader != null) {
            bufferedReader.close();
        }
        if (bufferedWriter != null) {
            bufferedWriter.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException error) {
        error.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
Define a method to close all resources (socket, bufferedReader, and bufferedWriter) associated with the client.
First, call the removeClientHandler method to remove the current ClientHandler from the list and notify other clients that the user has left.
Then, close the socket, bufferedReader, and bufferedWriter if they are not null.
Catch any IOException that may occur during the closing process and print the stack trace for debugging purposes.
